[X] polling to discord channel if bot is online (heartbeat)
[X] Ranks (If possible, A command that shows who needs to be ranked up. We normally use a spreadsheet but alot of manual work has to go into it. Maybe a command like !rankups And it pulls who needs to be ranked up for that month? We do it 1st month in clan, 3rd month in clan, 6 months in clan and OG role. Might be worth waiting on this till clan system update as ranks and times will change )
